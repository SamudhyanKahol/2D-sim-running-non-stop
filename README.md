# 2D Simulation: Running Non-Stop Through a City

Iâ€™m building a simulation where a character runs continuously through a 2D city map, tracking how many times they collide with cars. The aim is to estimate the probability of a crash occurring when moving non-stop through an urban environment.

## Goals

- Give each car its own individual behavior
- Simulate varying traffic densities depending on the time of day
- Implement robust and accurate crash detection

This project is an exploration of probabilistic modeling, movement logic, and urban dynamics through simulation.
